Michael Lee, a 72-year-old male born December 5, 1952, presented on April 18, 2025 to the inpatient orthopedic ward after sustaining a fall at home resulting in right hip pain and inability to ambulate. He has a 12-year history of osteoarthritis and a 5-year history of stage III chronic kidney disease, and reports allergies to codeine—nausea and vomiting—and shrimp, causing bronchospasm. His current medications include Ibuprofen 400 mg as needed, Lisinopril 20 mg once daily, and Calcium carbonate 500 mg with meals; he denies gastrointestinal upset.

On April 19 his vital signs were blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, temperature 36.9 °C, weight 75.3 kg, and height 170 cm. Laboratory studies drawn April 18 revealed hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL, creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, BUN 34 mg/dL, serum sodium 136 mmol/L, and albumin 3.6 g/dL; hip radiographs confirmed an intertrochanteric fracture of the right femur. He was diagnosed with right hip fracture, osteoarthritis, and CKD stage III; the plan was surgical fixation with cephalomedullary nailing under spinal anesthesia, preoperative optimization of hydration, postoperative analgesia with acetaminophen and gabapentin, and early mobilization with physiotherapy beginning on postoperative day 1.

In progress notes dated April 22, he reported manageable pain levels, stable renal function, ambulating with assistance using a walker, and was advised to continue calcium and vitamin D supplementation and follow up in the orthopedic clinic in two weeks.
