John Doe, a 68-year-old male born March 22, 1957, presented on April 15, 2025 to the outpatient clinic complaining of progressive fatigue and increased urinary frequency over the past month. He has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 10-year history of essential hypertension, and reports allergies to penicillin—triggering urticarial rash—and latex, causing contact dermatitis. His current medications include Metformin 500 mg twice daily, Lisinopril 10 mg once daily, and Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly; he denies adverse effects aside from occasional lightheadedness. On April 16 his vital signs were blood pressure 142/88 mmHg, heart rate 78 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, temperature 37.2 °C, weight 82.4 kg, and height 175 cm. Laboratory studies drawn April 14 revealed an HbA1c of 7.8 %, fasting glucose 156 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, white blood cell count 6.2 × 10⁹/L, and serum sodium 138 mmol/L. He was diagnosed with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia; the plan was to up-titrate Metformin to 1,000 mg twice daily, reinforce a low-sodium diet, and arrange a two-week follow-up. In progress notes dated April 18, he reported better dietary adherence but persistent orthostatic dizziness, was instructed to continue home glucose monitoring, maintain hydration, and return sooner if symptoms worsened.
